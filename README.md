# Quest Graph

## Introduction

This is a tool for creating dialogue and quest structures using a graph view. The work is still in progress.

The graph system is based at its core off of Indie Wafflus tutorial series [Dialogue System (Node Based)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvELzBYMK1U&list=PL0yxB6cCkoWK38XT4stSztcLueJ_kTx5f) but has been greatly expanded to provide support for creating quests.

Features:


* Node graph for creating, saving and loading branching dialogue 
* Node graph for creating, saving and loading quest structures
* Runtime functionality to display dialogue
* Runtime functionality for running quests

## Installation

The project is currently in the form of a standalone Unity project and therefore no installation is needed to use the project itself provided you have the Unity version 2021.3.24f1. It is likely the project works in later versions of Unity as well, but I cannot guarantee it. In the future I hope to change it so that it can be downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, but more updates are needed before I feel comfortable releasing it there.

## Usage

Documentation on the parts of the tools a guide on how to use the tool and a class diagram can be found in this [zip-file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZEhgC2A6yhQt9h_DpFg0HFmpkeYqxWoY/view?usp=sharing)

## Contribution

I will not open the repo up to edits right now, but I have no problems if you want to download and edit the project yourself.
