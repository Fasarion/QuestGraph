# Quest Graph

## Introduction

This is a tool for creating dialogue and quest structures using a graph view.

The system is based at its core off of Indie Wafflus tutorial series [Dialogue System (Node Based)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvELzBYMK1U&list=PL0yxB6cCkoWK38XT4stSztcLueJ_kTx5f)

## Installation

The project is currently in the form of a standalone Unity project and therefore no installation is needed to use the project itself provided you have the Unity version 2021.3.24f1. It is likely the project works in later versions of Unity as well, but I cannot guarantee it. In the future I hope to change it so that it can be downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, but more updates are needed before I feel comfortable releasing it there.

## Usage:
